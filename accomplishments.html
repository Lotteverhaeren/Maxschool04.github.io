<h1> Accomplishments </h1>
<p> I am only 16 which means that my experiences are limited. I have yet to discover new things like website development, coding and how to design it.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>To sum up a few of my latest accomplishments:</strong>
  <li>I have achieved my KM Cisco certificate</li>
  <li>I have succesfully completed Havo 4</li>
  <li>I am doing First Certificate English (FCE) </li>
  <br>
<p> I hope I will be able to accomplish more in the near future like finishing high school and going to college.</p>
