<h1> Development </h1>
<p> I have developed myself into a social, creative, eager to learn and flexible person</p>
<br>
<p>Since I was a little kid I always wanted to be in the spotlight, I always pushed myself to the limits in order to be in the center of attention. Of all the 15 boys in my class, I got chosen to compete in the
  reading contest which I finished second of our school, I was also the main character in the group 8th musical. Now I do not always want to be in the spotlight anymore, but I still work hard for the things I want
  to achieve. My focus now is on becoming an airtraffic controller. </p>
<br>
<p> I have also done tons of social work. I have volunteerd on helping in elderly homes and used to help at the local library.
